# troubleshooters-hub

**Project background**:

In the fast-paced and highly competitive software industry, innovation often focuses on large-scale solutions, leaving smaller, niche problems overlooked. This semester's project theme: “Small Audience, Real Impact”, challenges you to identify and address specific issues faced by individuals or small groups within your community. Form a team of students in your practical, and brainstorm tailored solutions that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of you preferred audience.

What is a small audience? This is up to you to decide, but you can think of this as any group that needs further qualification besides just saying 'users'. You can focus on a local community with a problem to solve (via software) that is unique to their geographical area. Or you can think about a group of users sharing in a passion for a particular game or craft. Or else you can think of groups of users sharing in a personal, cultural, linguistic, educational, social, or other background. 

**Minimal Requirements**:

Each project will need to provide a certain amount of features/functionalities, so, even when not explicitly mentioned in the project idea, consider that you will need to have:

- a graphical user interface with windows for the main functionalities, in general based on JavaFX
- an authentication system to sign-up/sign-in (GUI and models)
- a persistency system to store/retrieve/update user data (GUI and models)
- one or (more likely) more application windows in which the actual, useful part of the application is performed (again, with GUI and models)
